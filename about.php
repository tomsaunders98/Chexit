		<h1>About this website</h1>
	<p>I had the idea to create this website during the first phases of the Tory leadership contest, in which candidates both in favour and against no-deal sought to cast themselves in a light which sometimes bore little resemblanc to their actual voting record. Rory Stewart has vowed to rule out no-deal in the unlikely event that he would become Prime Minister. However, a cursory look at his <a href="search.php?id=574" >voting profile</a> shows that Rory voted against ruling out no-deal or even declaring his position against it at almost every turn.</p>
	<p>This isn't to say that positions can't evolve and in the case of Rory Stewart you could certainly say that as a leadership candidate he has finally had a chance to speak his mind instead of following the Conservative whip. However, it's up to the individual voter whether they believe the sincerity of an MP: this site's purpose is to give the voter the information to make that decision.</p>
	<p>Publicists often manipulate these votes in order to push their own progrms. For example, take Labour who are being bashed by both side of the debate. On the one hand the Liberal Democrats claimed that <a href="https://www.libdems.org.uk/labour-brexit-record">Labour abstained from a no deal vote,</a> whilst Conservatives have claimed that Labour have consistently voted against Brexit. However, an examination shows that in reality neither are true, <a href="http://localhost/aclearvote/search.php?id=114">Labour</a> has voted generally to avoid No Deal and Labour has also generally voted for their own versions of Brexit. In fact they have generally voted for everything but No Deal, Revoke or the Conservative Brexit option. </p>
	<p> In essence this site can hopefully serve as a complement to other websites such as <a href="http://www.fullfact.org"> fullfact.org</a> in delivering information on Brexit in a way that is completely unbiased and non-partisan whilst also helping to combat against the rise in fake news and disinformation coming from the political fringes.</p>
